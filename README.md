2. Click **Install**.

## Configuration

1. Set a Static IP Address to your [RainBird](https://www.rainbird.com) Controller - [How to Set Static IP Address](https://www.howtogeek.com/184310/ask-htg-should-i-be-setting-static-ip-addresses-on-my-router/).
2. Input Static IP Address and Password for [RainBird](https://www.rainbird.com) Controller into Plugin UI Settings and restart Homebridge.
    - If you choose to create child bridge with this plugin, do it at this time.

## Compatiable Controllers

Any controller that supports the [RainBird LNK WiFi Module](https://www.rainbird.com/products/lnk-wifi-module) should be compatible. This includes:
- ESP-Me
- ESP-TM2
- ESP-RZXe
- ESP-ME3 (see "Known Limitations")

## Known Limitations
- Using the RainBird app while the plugin is running can cause connectivity issues.
- The RainBird LNK WiFi Module may not support "Band Steering" and WiFi Channel 13. Try not using these on your router if you are having connectivity issues.
- ESP-ME3: It is not currently possible to show the time remaining for a zone that was not started via the plugin (such as a scheduled program). The time remaining will show as `00:00` in these cases. Also a zone will show as active even though a scheduled program has been suspended (due to rain).
- iOS 15.4/macOS 12.3 introduced a bug that prevents the valves (zones) from showing within the Irrigation System accessory in the Home app. Try using the "Show Zones as Valve Accessories" option as a workaround.
